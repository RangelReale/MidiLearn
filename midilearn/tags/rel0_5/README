MIDILearn 0.4
=============
MidiLearn is a program to learn how to play music without needing to know how to read a score. Using common MID or KAR files, one of the tracks is muted and displayed in a custom piano roll view created to be easy and fast to read.

At first run, select a MIDI output port and a song directory.

To play, open a song, choose a track you want to play and press its "Notes" and "Enabled" button, and press Play to start.
